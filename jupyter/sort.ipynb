    "我们下面尝试使用DIN模型， DIN的全称是Deep Interest Network， 这是阿里2018年基于前面的深度学习模型无法表达用户多样化的兴趣而提出的一个模型， 它可以通过考虑【给定的候选广告】和【用户的历史行为】的相关性，来计算用户兴趣的表示向量。具体来说就是通过引入局部激活单元，通过软搜索历史行为的相关部分来关注相关的用户兴趣，并采用加权和来获得有关候选广告的用户兴趣的表示。与候选广告相关性较高的行为会获得较高的激活权重，并支配着用户兴趣。该表示向量在不同广告上有所不同，大大提高了模型的表达能力。所以该模型对于此次新闻推荐的任务也比较适合， 我们在这里通过当前的候选文章与用户历史点击文章的相关性来计算用户对于文章的兴趣。 该模型的结构如下：\n",
